# Tiago Guerreiro - Portfolio

## Previews

I'm trying to make my portfolio as responsive as possible on different screens! So I used media query technology, flexbox and some javascript code to help me achieve this goal! In the prints below, some things may be out of place, this is due to the browser printscreen, it was a bit buggy, so I ask you to click on the link to test the website on your device using this link: https://sorenkazam.github.io/portfolio/
